- **Stage 2** (Studio) and Stage 3 (Player) can develop in parallel after Stage 1
- **Stage 4** (Scoring) depends on Stage 3 completion
- **Stage 5** (Collaboration) can start after Stage 2 is stable
- **Stage 6** (Integration) requires all previous stages to be functional

### **Parallel Development Opportunities**
- **Frontend Studio** (Stage 2) and **Backend APIs** (Stage 1) can overlap
- **Player Development** (Stage 3) and **Studio Polish** (Stage 2) can run concurrently
- **Testing & Documentation** can be ongoing throughout all stages

### **Quality Gates**
- Each stage requires ‚â•70% test coverage for backend core packages
- All interactive components must pass WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility checks
- OpenAPI specifications must be updated when endpoints change
- Documentation must be updated for all public API changes

---

## üìù **Notes**

- **Follow `.cursorrules` strictly** for all code generation
- **Maintain monorepo structure** as defined in project standards
- **Use industry standards** (Adaptive Cards, QTI 3.0, xAPI) for portability
- **Prioritize accessibility** and testing throughout development
- **Keep PRs < 400 LOC** and focused on single logical changes
